Simply set it up in the settings tab, then add or edit an existing post/page, and notice that the editor will now have some new buttons. The basic one is the 'Googoosify' button. If you click that the post/page will display a 'MS Word' button below it that allows users to download the content to Microsoft Word. There are other buttons for headers, and footers, etc.
