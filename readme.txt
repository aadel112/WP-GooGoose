This plugin allows the conversion of rich html WordPress content to a Microsoft Word Document with rapid download speed.

== Description ==
This plugin add custom buttons to the tinymce (wysiwyg) editor in the WordPress page/post/etc editing area, that allow configuring content to be downloaded to a word document.

When the end-user is viewing this content, they will have the ability to download the content as a Microsoft Word document if that ability is enabled by the admin in the editor.
