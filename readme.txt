== Description ==
This plugin add custom buttons to the tinymce (wysiwyg) editor in the WordPress page/post/etc editing area, that allow configuring content to be downloaded to a word document.

When the end-user is viewing this content, they will have the ability to download the content as a Microsoft Word document if that ability is enabled by the admin in the editor.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

= Frequently Asked Questions =

= How do I use this plugin? =

Simply set it up in the settings tab, then add or edit an existing post/page, and notice that the editor will now have some new buttons. The basic one is the 'Googoosify' button. If you click that the post/page will display a 'MS Word' button below it that allows users to download the content to Microsoft Word. There are other buttons for headers, and footers, etc.

If something doesn't look like it's working right, it's probably a good idea to add some content before using any if the googoose options.
